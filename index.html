    <p>I'm a twenty-four year old guy living in Phoenix, Arizona, trying to learn to code.</p>
    <p>I'm hoping that this exercise in web develop can one day down the road help me land a job that I enjoy in the technology sector, or maybe website development for a major political campaign.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to document my life as I develop:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>My Programming Ability</li>
      <li>My Physical Fitness </li>
      <li>My Photography</li>
      </ul>
